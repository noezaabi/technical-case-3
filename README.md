# Interview Case 3 - Interviewee Package

This is the candidate version of the backend case.

## Goal

Implement a robust catalog sync flow in TypeScript, including:

- Efficient diffing
- Transaction-safe persistence
- Idempotent and lock-aware orchestration

## Start

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

## Where to work

- Implement TODOs in `src/candidate/catalog-sync-use-case.ts`
- Read context in `docs/01-brainstorming-case.md`
- Read coding instructions in `docs/02-implementation-case.md`

## Notes

- Keep public APIs unchanged
- Do not modify tests
- Explain your trade-offs during debrief
